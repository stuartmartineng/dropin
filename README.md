# Dropin League Management
The Goal of this app is to make managing recreational sports leagues easy.  Whether you are just trying to pick teams for your pickup Volleyball game or you are organizing teams for massive leagues.

## Inspiration
Dropin started at my university dropin volleyball session.  We were having trouble picking teams that would make competitive games without hurting anyones feelings.  The idea of dropin is to have users vote anonymously on skill levels of each player and have software decide team without revealing the ranking to the players.

## Technologies
Dropin leverages React and Redux on the frontend with the goal of delivering a intuitive user experience.  The backend combines the power of DJango and a Postgres database.

## Current Development Status
User authentication has just been completed and users can now register and sign in to accounts.  Next steps will be to add functionality of adding leagues and creating teams.
